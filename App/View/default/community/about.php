        <h1>What is PPI?</h1>
        
        <div class="desc">
        <p>Conceptually, PPI is a php framework that combines power and simplicity.</p>
        <p>Technically, PPI is a simple web framework which harnesses the power of Symfony2, ZendFramework2 and Doctrine2.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h1>Design Goals</h1>
        <div class="desc">
        <ul>
            <li>Minimise the learning curve of using such powerful components.</li>
            <li>Do not re-invent the wheel! Choose the best component for the job from an existing library and make is easily accessible for the developer.</li>
            <li>Designed to be cloud compatible from the beginning.</li>
            <li>To harness the capabilities of larger more complex frameworks and convey them in a more productive and approachable manner.</li>
            <li>To give developers coming from frameworks such as CodeIgniter, Kohana, CakePHP a platform to step up and use much more powerful components while retaining the simplistic routes of those frameworks they've came from.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h1>Key Aspects</h1>
        <div class="desc">
        <ul>
            <li>Fully PSR compliant. You can use all of your existing compatible PSR code in PPI.</li>
            <li>Re-use of time/code invested in learning/using other frameworks.</li>
            <li>Clean and simple.</li>
            <li>Minimal and useful (non-intrusive)</li>
            <li>Well documented.</li>
            <li>Pragmatic but feature rich.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h1>Advantages</h1>
        <div class="desc">
        <ul>
            <li>If you know Symfony2 or ZendFramework2 you already know what you're doing in PPI. Therefore all the time you've invested in learning these frameworks can be re-used in building PPI apps.</li>
            <li>Knowledge you gain from using PPI will be invaluable to you out there in the wild-wild-web. It's teaching you how to use ZendFramework and Symfony and bits of Doctrine at the same time</li>
